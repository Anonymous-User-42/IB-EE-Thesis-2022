\textit{In this paper, I have shown the effects of changes in the \textbf{mass} in an \textbf{elastic pendulum} oscillating in a fluid medium (Air(Damped motion)) on the \textbf{radial displacement}, \textbf{angular displacement}, \textbf{angular frequency} and \textbf{absolute frequency} by collecting raw data relating to the above parameters, under certain controlled conditions. Also I have shown the possible \textbf{uncertainties in measurement} of the \textbf{radial displacement}, \textbf{angular displacement}, \textbf{angular frequency} and \textbf{absolute frequency}.}
