\textit{Upon close observation of the \textbf{drag versus time} it is evident that, the drag periodically decreases with decrease in mass and increases in amplitude and frequency with steady increase in mass}

\textit{As mentioned before, the viscous drag that is in play, exhibits underdamping that is the damping ratio involved in this example is less than 1 ($\zeta < 1$).}

\textit{The system exhibits an interesting feature, that of constant logarithmic decrements, that is,}
        
    $$\ln{\frac{x_1}{x_2}} = \ln{\frac{x_2}{x_3}} = \ln{\frac{x_3}{x_4}} = \cdots\cdots\cdots$$
        
\textit{Where $x_n$ and $x_{n + 1}$ are the amplitudes of any two successive peaks ($n \in \mathbb{R}$).}
        
\textit{Also interestingly that for any two successive peaks, if we define,}
        
    $$\delta = \ln{\left(\frac{x_n}{x_{n + 1}}\right)}$$
        
\textit{Then,}
        
    $$\zeta = \frac{\delta}{\sqrt{\delta^2 + \left(2\pi\right)^2}}$$
        
\textit{With the above findings and definitions, we can create an expression for percentage overshoot, that is,}
        
    $$\textit{Percentage Overshoot} = 100\cdot\exp{\left(-\frac{\zeta\pi}{\sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}}\right)}$$
        
\textit{Consequently we can find an expression for $\zeta$ in terms of \textbf{percentage overshoot} (PO). That is,}
        
    $$\zeta = \frac{-\ln{\left(\frac{PO}{100}\right)}}{\sqrt{\pi^2 + \ln^2{\left(\frac{PO}{100}\right)}}}$$
        
\textit{\textbf{Note}: $\zeta$ here, in the context of Drag forces and resistive forces symbolizes the damping ratio.}
