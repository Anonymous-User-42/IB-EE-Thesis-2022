\textit{We will discuss the effects of change in the magnitude of \textbf{spring stiffness constant} on the magnitude of the \textbf{radial position}, \textbf{angular position} and the \textbf{integral frequency} of the system of the damped harmonic oscillator, by collecting raw data on the measurement of (\textbf{radial position} with respect to time and \textbf{angular position} with respect to time) under certain controlled spaces with \textbf{defined standard initial conditions}.}
