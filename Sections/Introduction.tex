\textit{I have chosen this research question because the fundamental relation between the \textbf{mechanics of the damped elastic pendulum}, its \textbf{complex dynamics}, its \textbf{unstable chaotic behavior} and its \textbf{excruciating difficulty in possibly modeling} has led me to explore this field, as this phenomenon is exciting, unique and wonderful.}
%, with ample scope to carry out research and collect data both \textbf{quantitatively} and \textbf{qualitatively}.}
