\textit{It is my humble understanding and \textbf{hypothesis} that the \textbf{system of the damped elastic pendula} would act very similar to the the \textbf{dynamics of the damped simple pendulum}, and that the damping that would take place would be \textbf{nearly equal} as as to the damped simple pendulum, which means that the \textbf{motion should be approximately similar to to the simple pendulum}.}
